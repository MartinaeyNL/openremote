## Quickstart
Documentation, quickstart, and guides can be found on the main [OpenRemote repository](https://github.com/openremote/openremote) repository.

## Contributing
Feel free to reuse, fork, or do any customization for your own projects.<br />
Just keep in mind that I originally made this for my own usecases, so I'm not necessairly trying to maintain yours haha<br />
